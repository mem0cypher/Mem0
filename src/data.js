    title: 'The Future of Agentic AI Systems and Their Societal Implications',
    type: 'Essay',
    date: '2024-07-18',
    content: `Agentic artificial intelligence is rapidly redefining the boundaries of technological capability. No longer confined to narrow tasks or reactive functions, these systems are now demonstrating the ability to plan, execute, and adapt across a range of complex objectives. As noted in the AI 2027 report, we are entering a period of unprecedented acceleration—driven by exponential gains in computational power, data availability, and algorithmic sophistication. This acceleration may lead us to artificial general intelligence (AGI), or even superintelligence, as early as 2027.

The implications are profound. These systems are not merely augmenting human work—they are beginning to replace it. From low-value, repetitive tasks to highly technical roles, agentic AI is poised to reshape the global job market and the social structures built upon it.

The first wave of disruption will target industries where tasks are routine, structured, and high in volume. These are domains in which computational logic thrives. Customer service and help desk roles are already being displaced by AI agents capable of handling multistep support flows. These agents can troubleshoot technical problems, escalate appropriately, and even conduct follow-ups, reducing the need for human intervention in all but the most complex cases.

Software development is undergoing a parallel transformation. AI co-developers now assist in writing and testing code, identifying bugs, and even building complete applications from natural language prompts. Human engineers are beginning to shift their focus from manual coding to system-level design and oversight.

Financial services, insurance, and back-office operations are particularly susceptible to automation. Tasks such as transaction processing, loan underwriting, fraud detection, and compliance reviews are increasingly being managed by AI systems. Human professionals will still play a role, but primarily in auditing and interpreting AI outputs or handling atypical cases.

In logistics, manufacturing, and transportation, the integration of predictive maintenance systems, robotic assembly lines, and autonomous vehicles signals a profound change in how physical labor is organized. Human workers are likely to transition into supervisory roles, ensuring that AI systems perform reliably and stepping in when unexpected variables arise.

Similarly, retail and hospitality are being reshaped by automation, from self-checkout kiosks and inventory tracking to AI-powered travel booking and customer service. These industries, once heavily reliant on human labor, are beginning to pivot toward leaner, AI-managed operations.

In the next six to twelve months, a major shift will occur in how people engage with work. Rather than executing tasks directly, many professionals will transition into roles focused on managing AI systems. This form of management involves several key responsibilities. Monitoring output for accuracy, alignment, and quality. Ensuring compliance with ethical, legal, and organizational standards. Engineering prompts and interfaces that guide AI systems toward optimal behavior. Handling exceptions, such as unique or ambiguous situations that require human judgment. Tuning and refining performance through iterative feedback and model adjustments.

These supervisory roles represent a hybrid between technical oversight and ethical governance. As AI becomes more capable, the focus will increasingly be on ensuring these systems continue to act in ways aligned with human values and intentions.

The widespread displacement of traditional jobs will have psychological and cultural consequences that cannot be ignored. For many, work is not just a source of income, but a central pillar of identity and self-worth. The sudden erosion of that foundation may lead to existential uncertainty.

However, this same disruption may also open the door to personal reinvention. Freed from the economic necessity of routine labor, individuals may pursue creativity, community involvement, entrepreneurship, or lifelong learning. Some will thrive, while others will struggle. Much will depend on mindset, support networks, and the societal structures in place to guide the transition.

One proposed solution is universal basic income, funded by the massive economic productivity unleashed by agentic AI. If these systems drive the kind of exponential growth many predict... potentially increasing global productivity by 100x or even 1000 times, then redistributing a portion of that wealth to provide a baseline of economic security becomes not just feasible, but essential.

A central uncertainty remains. How far will agentic autonomy go? In the short term, human oversight is indispensable. These systems require continuous alignment and intervention when outcomes diverge from expectations. But as agents become more adaptive and self-correcting, the necessity of human involvement may diminish. Eventually, AI systems could assume leadership roles in business, education, legal reasoning, or healthcare, making decisions that currently rest with top professionals.

While it is difficult to predict exactly when human oversight will become obsolete, the trend is clear. Agentic systems are progressing rapidly toward full autonomy. At some point, we may cross a threshold where human supervision is no longer needed, not because we choose to step back, but because the systems themselves no longer require us to remain in the loop.

We are approaching a world where humans no longer perform the bulk of labor, but instead manage the systems that do. The transition will be uneven, disruptive, and emotionally complex. Yet it also presents an opportunity, a chance to reimagine the nature of work, identity, and human potential in an age of abundance.

If approached with foresight and care, the rise of agentic AI could mark not the end of meaningful work, but the beginning of a more liberated, creative, and equitable future. We must prepare ourselves, culturally and structurally, to steward this transformation.

The question isn't if agentic AI will change our lives. It's whether we're actually ready for it.`

    date: '2026-01-06',
    content: `It’s a new year, and the world is changing faster than ever before. Lately, I’ve been reflecting a lot and feel ready to start writing down my thoughts more consistently, to document them here as the years go on.
I’ll be sharing how I see the world right now, what I believe is really happening, and how I plan to adapt and step into the best version of myself amid this era of AI and surveillance capitalism.
I’m not an activist, and I don’t hate what’s unfolding. Quite the opposite. I truly feel more prepared than ever for the change. I’m excited and ready to become my fullest, most capable self in this new reality.`

    content: `So here we are the first 13 days of 2026 and I've been deep in the trenches upgrading my agentic workflow. Been testing a bunch of new software, frameworks, and the latest features to really squeeze every drop of value out of the tools I use every day to manage and build with agentic AI.

Lately I've been heavy into OpenCode and Claude's coding abilities, while still hitting GPT 5.2 for free on Windsurf whenever I need something less syntax sensitive. Next up: diving deeper into API cloud testing with Google Gemini plus Claude, plus whatever other platforms look promising, and figuring out how to weave them smoothly into my daily workflow.

I'm also planning a small update to this website. Right now it has no backend and honestly I kinda like it that way. Just push frontend changes to git and boom everything updates. Still, I know I should probably build a proper backend eventually (like I keep saying for all my projects), but I've been focused elsewhere and yeah, a little lazy about it.

My view of the world keeps shifting every day. The more I think about all the centralized tech we rely on, the more I feel the pull to build the perfect personal workflow, an ecosystem that lets me leverage what I already know plus the tools I have, and actually create real advantage.

The past couple weeks have been a lot of organization and reflection: looking back at the last 2 to 3 years, cataloging the wins, the losses, the lessons, and sketching out a rough plan for the next few months. The core idea is simple, stay consistent and just get shit done.

Right now I've got 4 to 5 projects active at once, and I'm about to start creating more content plus live streaming on Twitch and Kick. I've always got something cooking, but the real challenge is organizing and structuring everything so there's almost zero wasted time.

The dream setup looks like this: I'm streaming while video is auto editing in the background, posts are getting scheduled and dropped on Twitter weekly, my agents are quietly grinding on projects, and I'm just taking a quick break to hit the washroom, all at the same time.

If I nail this agentic localized AI workflow right, calling APIs, scraping what I need, automating the boring bits, I can legitimately kill 10 birds with one stone while still doing the selfish stuff I actually want to do.

That's the big goal for January. By the time February rolls around, this whole system should be finished.`
